# Step 1: Function Initialization

The code begins by defining a function called steps_to_farthest_point. This function takes in a sketch, which represents a 2D grid of pipes and symbols.

## Step 2: Determining Grid Size

It calculates the number of rows and columns in the sketch grid using the len() function. The variable rows holds the number of rows, and cols holds the number of columns in the grid.

```python
Copy code
rows = len(sketch)
cols = len(sketch[0])
```

## Step 3: Directional Definitions

A dictionary named directions is created to store movement directions for each pipe symbol in the grid. For example:

`-` or `|` pipes allow movement `horizontally` or `vertically`.
`L`, `J`, `7`, and `F` represent different `90-degree bends`.
`S` represents the starting point of the loop.

## Step 4: Validating Grid Coordinates

The is_valid function checks if a given coordinate `(x, y)` lies within the bounds of the grid.

Step 5: Depth-First Search (DFS)
The dfs function is a recursive function that performs a Depth-First Search. It explores adjacent pipes in the grid starting from a given position `(x, y)` and calculates the maximum distance along the loop from the starting position.

## Step 6: Finding the Starting Position 'S'

A loop iterates through the grid to find the starting position 'S' by locating its coordinates `(start_x, start_y)`.

## Step 7: Processing the Sketch Grid

If the starting position `S` is found, the code initializes a visited matrix to keep track of visited positions and initiates the DFS function to calculate the maximum distance along the loop.

## Step 8: Handling Invalid Input

If `S` is not found or the input is invalid, the function returns `-1`.

## Step 9: Reading Input from a File

The code reads the input sketch from a local file named `input.txt` and stores it as a list of strings `(sketch = [line.strip() for line in file.readlines()])`.

## Step 10: Executing the Main Function

Finally, it executes the `steps_to_farthest_point` function using the sketch obtained from the file. If the result is not `-1`, it prints the number of steps along the loop to the farthest point; otherwise, it prints an error message.

This code leverages the **DFS algorithm** to explore the pipe network, starting from the 'S' point, and calculates the maximum distance along the loop to determine the farthest point from the starting position.
